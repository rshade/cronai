# Application Monitoring Check

Based on the latest monitoring data, please provide:

1. Overall health status of each service (green/yellow/red)
2. Top 5 services with highest error rates in the past hour
3. Services with significant latency increases since the last check
4. Any detected patterns in error logs that might indicate emerging issues
5. Prioritized list of services that require immediate attention

If any critical issues are detected, include specific troubleshooting steps that should be taken immediately.

Note any correlations between service degradations and recent deployments or infrastructure changes.
