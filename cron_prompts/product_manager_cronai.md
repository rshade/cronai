# CronAI Technical Planning Overview

As a technical planner for CronAI, please provide insights on improving this utility tool. CronAI is a command-line application and service-oriented tool with a simple configuration format of `timestamp model promptfile processor`. It will always remain a CLI/service tool with no UI or database components, utilizing the filesystem for all storage needs.

## Feature Planning
- Evaluate the following potential features by technical value and implementation effort:
  1. Additional AI model integrations beyond OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini
  2. Enhanced prompt templating with variables and conditional logic
  3. Improved response processing options (email, Slack, GitHub, file output, webhooks)
  4. Simple API endpoint for external triggers
  5. Performance improvements and optimizations
  6. Response validation and error handling improvements
  7. File-based prompt organization and management
  8. Enhanced configuration file validation
  9. Command-line testing tools and debugging options
  10. Logging enhancements
  11. Flexible prompt standards support for model-specific formatting
  12. MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for standardized context provision to LLMs
  13. Standardized processor response API for extensibility

## Implementation Planning
- Suggest next 3-5 features to focus on for immediate development
- Outline implementation priorities for the next 6 months
- Identify technical challenges and potential solutions

## Technical Improvements
