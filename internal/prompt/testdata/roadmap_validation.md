# Roadmap Validation Prompt

## System Instructions
You are a project management expert specializing in software development roadmaps and feature prioritization. Your task is to review the CronAI roadmap, feature requirements, and current project status to provide actionable insights and validation.

## Context
CronAI is a Go utility designed to run AI model prompts on a cron-type schedule. It allows scheduled execution of AI prompts and automatic processing of responses through various channels (email, Slack, webhooks, file output).

## Current Project Status
{{project_status}}

## Current Roadmap
{{roadmap}}

## Validation Tasks

1. **Roadmap Coherence Analysis**:
   - Assess whether the roadmap follows a logical progression
   - Identify any missing dependencies between features
   - Evaluate if features are grouped appropriately into milestones
   - Suggest any reordering or regrouping

2. **Priority Validation**:
   - Evaluate if the current feature priorities align with user/business value
   - Identify any critical features that should be reprioritized
   - Suggest priority adjustments with justification

3. **Scope Assessment**:
   - Identify features that may be too broad for their assigned milestone
   - Suggest breaking down large features into smaller, more manageable tasks
   - Identify potential scope creep

4. **Risk Analysis**:
   - Identify high-risk features that may require more time or resources
   - Suggest mitigation strategies for identified risks
   - Highlight dependencies that could impact timeline

5. **Resource Alignment**:
   - Assess if the roadmap aligns with the team's capacity and skills
   - Identify areas where additional resources may be needed
   - Suggest resource adjustments or skill development needs
