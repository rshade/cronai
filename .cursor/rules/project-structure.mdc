# Project Structure Guide

This project follows a standard Go project layout with the following key directories:

- `cmd/`: Contains the main applications of the project
  - `cronai/`: Main CLI application
    - `cmd/`: Command implementations
    - `prompt.go`: Main entry point for prompt-related commands

- `internal/`: Private application and library code
  - `prompt/`: Core prompt management functionality
    - `loader.go`: Prompt loading and file operations
    - `loader_func_test.go`: Tests for prompt loading functions

- `pkg/`: Library code that's ok to use by external applications
  - `config/`: Configuration management
    - `model_config.go`: AI model configuration settings

The project is organized to separate concerns between CLI commands, core functionality, and configuration management. The `internal` package contains the main business logic, while `pkg` contains reusable components that could be used by other applications.
