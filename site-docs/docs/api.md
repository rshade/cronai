> **Note**: This document is a placeholder for future API documentation. The external API is planned for post-MVP releases.

This document will describe the API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms for CronAI's external API.

## Current Status

The external API is currently in development and planned for post-MVP releases. The MVP version does not include external API access.

## Planned API Features

The following API features are planned for future releases:

1. **Task Management API**
   - Create, read, update, and delete scheduled tasks
   - Control task execution (start, stop, pause)
   - Query task execution history and status

2. **Prompt Management API**
   - Create, read, update, and delete prompts
   - Organize prompts into categories
   - Test prompts with variables

3. **Model Management API**
   - Configure model parameters
   - View model usage and statistics
   - Test model execution

4. **Response Processing API**
   - Configure response processors
   - View response history
   - Query processed outputs

## API Design Principles

The future API will follow these design principles:

- RESTful architecture
- JSON request/response format
- Token-based authentication
- Comprehensive error responses
- Versioned endpoints
- Rate limiting
- Pagination for list endpoints

## Planned Endpoints

A preview of planned endpoints:

```http
# Task Management
GET    /api/v1/tasks
POST   /api/v1/tasks
GET    /api/v1/tasks/:id
PUT    /api/v1/tasks/:id
DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:id
POST   /api/v1/tasks/:id/execute

# Prompt Management
GET    /api/v1/prompts
POST   /api/v1/prompts
GET    /api/v1/prompts/:id
PUT    /api/v1/prompts/:id
DELETE /api/v1/prompts/:id
POST   /api/v1/prompts/:id/test

# Model Management
GET    /api/v1/models
GET    /api/v1/models/:id/config
PUT    /api/v1/models/:id/config
POST   /api/v1/models/:id/test

# Response Processing
GET    /api/v1/processors
GET    /api/v1/processors/:type/config
PUT    /api/v1/processors/:type/config
GET    /api/v1/responses
GET    /api/v1/responses/:id
```

## Authentication

Future API authentication will likely use:

- Bearer token authentication
- OAuth 2.0 integration (for third-party applications)
- Role-based access control

## Status Codes

The API will use standard HTTP status codes:

- `200 OK`: Successful request
- `201 Created`: Resource created successfully
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid authentication
- `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient permissions
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error

## Stay Tuned

The API documentation will be expanded as the external API is implemented. Check back in future releases for comprehensive API documentation.
