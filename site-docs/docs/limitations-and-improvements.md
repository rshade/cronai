# CronAI: Known Limitations and Future Improvements

This document outlines the current limitations of CronAI's MVP release and planned improvements for future versions. Understanding these limitations will help users make informed decisions about deployment and usage.

## Current MVP Limitations

### Core Functionality

#### Model Execution

- **No Model Fallback Mechanism**: The MVP doesn't include the fallback mechanism to try alternative models when the primary model fails, despite the code structure supporting it.
- **Fixed API Timeouts**: All model API calls use a hard-coded 120-second timeout without configuration options.
- **Limited Error Diagnostics**: Error messages focus on API communication issues rather than providing detailed diagnostics for model-specific errors.
- **No Request Validation**: There's no pre-execution validation of prompt length against token limits, potentially leading to truncated or failed requests.
- **No Rate Limiting Protection**: No built-in mechanisms to prevent API quota exhaustion or honor rate limits from providers.
- **Limited Cost Management**: No token counting or budget enforcement mechanisms to control API costs.
- **No Streaming Support**: Only supports synchronous request/response patterns, not streaming responses which would be useful for longer generations.

#### Response Processing

- **Limited Processor Options**: Only supports File, GitHub, and Console processors in the MVP.
- **No Email Integration**: Email processor is planned but not implemented in the MVP.
- **No Slack Integration**: Slack processor is planned but not implemented in the MVP.
- **No Webhook Integration**: Webhook processor is planned but not implemented in the MVP.
- **No Processor Chaining**: Cannot route a single response through multiple processors.
- **No Response Templating**: Basic response handling without advanced templating capabilities.
- **Limited Formatting Options**: Minimal control over output formatting and structure.

#### Prompt Management

- **No Template Inheritance**: Cannot create prompt templates that inherit from base templates.
- **No Conditional Logic**: No support for conditional sections in prompts.
- **Basic Variable Substitution**: Simple variable replacement without complex data types or expressions.
- **No Versioning**: No built-in versioning for prompt files.
- **Limited Prompt Organization**: Basic directory-based organization without tagging or advanced metadata.

#### Scheduling and Execution

- **Standard Cron Limitations**: Uses standard cron format without more advanced scheduling options.
- **No Dynamic Scheduling**: Cannot update schedules without restarting the service.
- **Sequential Execution**: Tasks are executed sequentially without parallel processing capabilities.
- **No Task Prioritization**: All tasks have equal priority with no queue management.
- **No Execution History**: No persistent record of execution history beyond log files.

### Security and Observability

- **Basic API Key Management**: API keys stored directly in environment variables without rotation or secure storage options.
- **Limited Content Filtering**: Minimal content moderation capabilities.
- **No Authentication/Authorization**: No user management or role-based access control.
- **Limited Audit Logging**: No comprehensive tracking of system access or configuration changes.
- **Basic Monitoring**: Limited metrics and monitoring capabilities.
- **Limited Logging**: Basic logging without structured query capabilities or centralized log management.

### Deployment and Scalability

- **Single-Instance Design**: No clustering or distributed execution capabilities.
- **Limited Installation Options**: Basic installation without containerization or orchestration.
- **No High Availability**: No built-in mechanisms for high availability or fault tolerance.
- **Limited Platform Integration**: Basic systemd integration without broader platform support.
- **No Storage Management**: No mechanisms to enforce data retention or manage disk usage.

## Planned Improvements

### Q3 2025 - Enhanced Usability

#### Additional Processors

- **Email Processor**: Send AI responses via email with customizable templates.
- **Slack Processor**: Post AI responses to Slack channels or direct messages.
- **Webhook Processor**: Send responses to configurable HTTP endpoints.

#### Response Enhancement

- **Response Templating System**: Create custom output formats with Go templates.
- **Processor Chaining**: Route responses through multiple processors.
- **Rich Content Support**: Better handling of structured data in responses.

#### Prompt Management Enhancements

- **Conditional Logic**: Add if/else conditions to prompt templates.
- **Template Inheritance**: Create base templates that can be extended.
- **Variable Data Types**: Support for complex data types in variables.
- **Prompt Version Control**: Track changes to prompt files over time.

#### User Experience

- **Basic Web UI**: Simple web interface for managing tasks and prompts.
- **Improved Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples.
- **Enhanced CLI**: More powerful command-line options and utilities.

### Q4 2025 - Integration & Scale

#### Reliability Features

- **Model Fallback Mechanism**: Automatic fallback to alternative models when primary model fails.
- **Dynamic Rate Limiting**: Smart handling of API rate limits.
- **Retry Policies**: Configurable retry behavior for transient failures.

#### External Integration

- **External API**: RESTful API for managing CronAI from other applications.
- **SDK Support**: Client libraries for popular programming languages.
- **Webhook Events**: Push notifications for task execution events.

#### Performance & Monitoring

- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed metrics for execution time, token usage, and costs.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visual representation of system performance.
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor and control AI model costs.

#### Scalability

- **Distributed Task Execution**: Run tasks across multiple nodes.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add capacity by adding more nodes.
- **Execution Queues**: Prioritize and manage task execution.

### Q1 2026 - Enterprise Features

#### Security Enhancements

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for users and groups.
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Encrypted storage for API keys and secrets.
- **SSO Integration**: Support for enterprise authentication systems.

#### Compliance & Governance

- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all system operations.
- **Compliance Reports**: Generate reports for regulatory requirements.
- **Data Retention Policies**: Configure automatic pruning of old data.

#### Advanced Monitoring

- **Alerting System**: Configurable alerts for system issues.
- **Health Checks**: Proactive monitoring of system components.
- **Advanced Logging**: Structured logs with search capabilities.

#### Enterprise Deployment

- **High Availability**: Resilient deployment options.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup and restore capabilities.
- **Enterprise Support**: SLA-backed support options.

## Workarounds for Current Limitations

While waiting for future improvements, consider these workarounds for current limitations:

### For Model Limitations

- Use shorter prompts to avoid token limits
- Implement external rate limiting via scheduling
- Use appropriate model versions for your needs
- Monitor costs manually via model provider dashboards

### For Processor Limitations

- Use the file processor combined with external tools for additional processing
- Create scripts to watch output files and trigger additional actions
- Use GitHub issues/comments for collaborative workflows

### For Prompt Management

- Structure prompts with clear sections for easy maintenance
- Use descriptive variable names and documenting their purpose
- Create documentation for prompt design patterns

### For Scheduling and Execution

- Use staggered scheduling to avoid resource contention
- Implement external monitoring of CronAI logs
- Create separate configuration files for different task categories
