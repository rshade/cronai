- **Prioritization**: Focus on high-impact issues first

## When to Request Changes
- Security vulnerabilities
- Potential bugs or race conditions
- Missing critical tests
- Breaking API changes without discussion
- Performance regressions

## When to Approve
- Minor style issues that don't affect functionality
- Documentation improvements
- Well-tested feature additions
- Bug fixes with proper tests
